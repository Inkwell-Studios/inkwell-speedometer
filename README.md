---

A sleek, GTA V-inspired speedometer interface for FiveM, built as a practical example using the robust [Inkwell FiveM React Template](https://github.com/Inkwell-Studios/fivem-react-template).

## Overview

This resource provides a clean and functional speedometer HUD designed to integrate seamlessly with the default Grand Theft Auto V aesthetic. It displays essential vehicle information including speed (MPH), current gear, RPM, and fuel level using intuitive bar indicators.

This project serves as an example of how the Inkwell FiveM React Template can be used to create functional NUI interfaces.

## Features

*   **GTA V Aesthetic:** Designed to look and feel like a native part of the game's HUD.
*   **Clear Readouts:** Displays Speed (MPH) and Current Gear prominently.
*   **Bar Indicators:** Segmented bars for RPM (with redline effect) and Fuel (color-coded for level).
*   **Automatic Visibility:** Appears only when driving a vehicle.
*   **Performance Optimized:** Lua script balanced for responsiveness without causing client strain.
*   **Boilerplate Example:** Serves as a clear example for developers using the Inkwell template.

## Built With

This project was built using the following core technology:

*   **[Inkwell FiveM React Template](https://github.com/Inkwell-Studios/fivem-react-template):** The foundational boilerplate providing the React, Tailwind CSS, and FiveM integration setup.
*   **React:** For building the user interface components.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.
*   **Lua:** For the FiveM client-side logic.
